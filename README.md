# WUEmu
The Wurm Unlimited server emulator project.

This README is just a placeholder for now.

‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π _I dedicate this project to my mother who has left this world, and my daughter, who has brought peace to my world._

## Progress

1. First step is to make the server protocol complete. This means that the server has all the network packets implemented and a basic test environment to validate the correctness of the protocol implementation.
2. The second step is to iron out the software architecture for the server.
3. TBD
